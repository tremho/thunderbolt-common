## TODO items

In general, I could use a clean-code review and target sections that could use improvement.  Maybe do some of this
before first release, and some after in maintenance drops.

- [ ] review use of types, especially 'any' declarations
- [X] StdComp needs a corresponding d.ts declaration.

Maybe create a Types module to gather all of these?
